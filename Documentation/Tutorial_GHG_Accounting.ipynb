    "# Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Accounting Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will help teach you to use the Project Drawdown Solutions Model. We'll go over how to calculate the greenhouse gas emission reductions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently updated and new features of the model calculate the total emission reductions for separate GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The model will also maintain its calculation of the total emission reduction in terms of CO2-equalivalent emissions. This allows the user to report emission reductions for separate gases and for the combined total CO2-eq GHG emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CO2-Equivalent vs. Individual Gas Emissions\n",
    "\n",
    "CO2-eq is a unit of measure that standardizes climate effects of greenhouse gases to the radiative forcing of a unit of carbon dioxide over a specified timeframe. In short, it allows us to compare the climate impact of CO2 to other different greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. \n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage to the CO2-eq unit is it’s a common unit for all greenhouse gases. This allows us to report the total greenhouse gas emissions by summing all the individual gases. Since CO2 equivalence provides a single number that encompasses all gases, the climate community has readily adapted this unit. However, there are a few drawbacks to using it. For one, when reported as a summed total, we cannot differentiate each gas and their contribution to the total emissions. This makes it difficult for policymakers to target strategies on certain activities or sectors for methane or nitrous oxide.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid ambiguity, Project Drawdown reports emission reductions in both CO2-eq emissions and individual GHGs emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O). There are many valuable reasons for reporting greenhouse gas emissions individually. For one, it improves the transparency and clarity about the solutions model assumptions. This enhances our trust in the model results. It also indicates what solutions may be most beneficial for targeting other greenhouse gases beyond just carbon dioxide. As cutting methane and nitrous oxide emissions become a growing concern for meeting nationally determined contributions and other long-term climate goals, reporting those emissions can help target Project Drawdown solutions and sectors to reach those objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How CO2-Equivalent is Calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "The way CO2-eq is calculated is by using an index called the Global Warming Potential (GWP). The GWP depends on two things. First, it depends on what greenhouse gas we are talking about. If it is methane, then we know that methane is more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than CO2, and that alone will increase the GWP. Second, the GWP depends on how long the greenhouse gas stays in the atmosphere or its lifetime – the time it takes before the gas is removed or chemically broken down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Drawdown currently uses the 100-year GWP for methane (GWP = 28) and nitrous oxide (GWP = 265). In a 100-year timespan, methane’s heat-trapping ability will drop to 28x more effective as a greenhouse gas than CO2. Another way of looking at the GWP is to say if 1 tonne of methane was released, it would create an equivalent warming as 28 tonnes of CO2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiply the total emissions for a particular greenhouse gas by the GWP of that gas to get CO2-eq. For instance, we emit on average 400 Megatons (Mt) of CH4 each year. This equates to 400 x 28 = 11.2 Gigatons (Gt) CO2-eq emissions annually. Now, if our emissions for nitrous oxide were 9 Mt-N2O, our annual CO2-eq emissions would be 9 x 265 = 2.4 Gt CO2-eq. As for CO2 emissions, the factor is 1 and we do not need to make a conversion.\n"
