Project Drawdown 2019 Perennial Bioenergy model based calculation,,,,4 - Independently Verified,2019,,21.127244559456702,US$2014/t,0.00429306710949529,US$2014 per kWh,,"Price is estimated by diving the average NPM  (362.5 US$/ha/yr, from perennial bioenergy model) from the average yield from perennial bioenergy crops (17.16 t/ha/yr, from biomass model), which comes out 21.12 US$/ton. This way we will be consistent across our diff models. We can use same conversion calculation (ton to Btu to KWh) to get the cost in KWh. For eg., 1 metric ton of average figure of switchgrass/baggase/miscanthus produces = 4589 KWh, this gives 0.0046 US$/KWh. ",
