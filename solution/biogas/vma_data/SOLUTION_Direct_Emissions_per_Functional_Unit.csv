GWP from AD + Feedstock prod & transport + digestate emissions: From J. Bacenetti et al. (2016): Agricultural anaerobic digestion plants: What LCA studies pointed out and what can be done to make them more environmentally sustainable. AD plants are fed with agricultural feedstock and produce biogas that is used, after being dehumidified with a chiller and desulphurised with a scrubber, in CHP ICE. Electricity consumed for operating the plants (mixers, pumps, scrubber, chiller, etc.) is taken from the grid. In the AD plant, the digestate is stored in open tanks and it is used as organic fertilizer for energy crops or for fodder production. All the processes involved in the electricity production, from the extraction of raw materials needed for energy crops cultivation and AD plant construction to the disposal of waste and infrastructures, have been considered in the system boundary. No environmental impacts are considered for animal slurries as they are waste.",1.0
