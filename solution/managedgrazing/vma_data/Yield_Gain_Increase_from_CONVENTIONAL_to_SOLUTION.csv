Chinese grasslands are usually overgrazed. This measure considers a stocking rate reduction to a medium intensity. While the grassland condition is improving, the dry matter production of the grasslands would increase by 10%. The grassland utilization rate is reduced to 50% and thus the higher amount of organic material entering the soil will increase the carbon sequestration rate",
